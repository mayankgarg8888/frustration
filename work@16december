.iwspy-> get wireless statistics from specific nodes
.iwlist-> get more detailed wireless information from a wireless interface
.iwevent-> display wireless events generated by drivers and setting changes, all events are generated on all wireless interfaces by the kernel wireless subsystem(but only if the driver has been converted to the new driver API), changes in setting of(network id, ESSID, frequency,mode,encryption)

				virt-inspector
.it can ony inspect and report one domain at a time,to inspect several virtual m/c,you have to run virt-inspector several times,
.it needs direct access to guest images,won't normally work over remote libvirt connections.
.libvirt is only used when you specify a "domname" on cmd,if you specify guest block devices directly then libvirt is not used at all.
.early versions of libguestfs shipped with a different virt-inspector program written in Perl(current version is written in C)
